            <span class="Bullet">1</span> The Regular deck of 52 cards is used in this game. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">2</span> The cards numbered from 2 to 9 equals to the point of their face values. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">3</span> Ace equals 1 point. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">4</span> King, Queen and Joker equals 0. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">5</span> The goal is to predict who will be getting more points, Banker, Player or it will be a tie. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">6</span> Therefore there are 3 spots on which you can bet. On the PLayer, on the Banker or a Tie. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">7</span> The dealer pulls 2 cards for the player and two for the banker. The sum of the cards counts as the point of the player or banker. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">8</span> If the count is over 10 then the digit on the units place is considered in that case. Like if the player gets 2+9 which is 11 the player will get only 1 point. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">9</span> If you guess correct the amount gets doubled. <br>
