            <span class="Bullet">1</span> There are 4 types of Bet in a single hand you can place. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">2</span> The first type of bet is the one placed on Even or Odd. If you place your bet on Even and the Number on the Roullete is an Even Number then you get your amount equivalent to double your bet. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">3</span> The second type of Bet is on the Dozens. If you look at the Roullete Table above there are 3 dozens available. You can bet on either one of these and if the ball on the Roullete is a number among that dozen then you get your amount equivalent to double your bet. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">4</span> The third type of Bet is on the Columns. In the table you can see there are 3 columns available so you can bet on anyone. And simmilarly like the Dozens bet your money gets doubled. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">5</span> These were the outer bets. Your total amount of the Outer bet should be atleast 10$. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">6</span> There is only one type of Inner bet and that is betting on the Number. You can bet on as many numbers you want but the total of the Inner bets should be 10$. <br>
            <span class="Bullet">7</span> If the Ball on the hits the Number you bet on then you get 35 times the amount you bet on the number. <br>
